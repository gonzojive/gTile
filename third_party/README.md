### gobject-introspection

The `third_party/gobject-introspection` directory contains files generated by
following the instructions at
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gobject-introspection/-/blob/master/HACKING to
build the project.

Instructions to regenerate the .d.ts files:

Build `gobject-introspection` in some other directory:

```shell
git clone https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gobject-introspection.git
cd gobject-introspection
meson _build
ninja -C _build
```

In the gtile top-level directory, copy the files from `gobject-introspection`:

```shell
cp /path/to/gobject-introspection/_build/gir/*.gir third_party/gobject-introspection
```

Generate typings from the `.gir` artifacts:

```shell
bazel run @npm//ts-gir/bin:ts-gir -- \
  --dir $PWD/third_party/gobject-introspection \
  --inputs $PWD/third_party/gobject-introspection/*.gir
```
